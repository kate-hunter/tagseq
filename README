Purpose: These scripts are for the purpose of analyzing the tag-seq data. I used snakemake to run a combination of bash, R, and perl scripts. 
--scripts run through the following steps-
---concatenating lanes
---trimming and quality filtering and removing duplicate reads
---indexing genomes
---aligning reads
---counting features
---creating a summary file for all the read steps

Contents:
-awk_scripts=just tst.awk, important to joining tables together
-bash_scripts=scripts mostly used in getting the summary files for outputs from each step
-perl_scripts=this is for the duplicate removal, taking out reads that didn't have the tags
-R_scripts=This was how I finally combined all of the outputs from the steps
-snake=includes snakefile, bash script for snake job submission, cluster file for parameter for submission
-tagseq_processing_code_anna=scripts from Anna Battenhouse at UT Austin shared for the trimming/duplicate removal/barcode-less removal step
